## Description
This is a two-player tank game where the objective is to destroy the other player's tank. The game is played in a maze-like map. <br />
The games go up to a specified value (first to that value wins), unless the user chose the Infinite Mode (toggled when the user changes the winning value to 0). Whoever hits that value first, wins the game.<br />
The bullets are shot from the tanks and bounce off the walls. The bullets have a lifespan, and after that lifespan, the bullets will disappear. <br />
The player is not able to kill themselves with their own bullets. <br />
From the main menu, the user can enter the game, or they can choose to change the settings. The settings will be saved to settings.txt so the preferences will be saved for the next time the user plays the game. <br />
From the settings page, the user is able to change the winning value, how many bullets the tanks can shoot at once, the reload delay period, and the bullets lifespan. <br />
Anytime during an ongoing game, the user can press the escape key to pause the game. From there, the user can choose to resume the game (Esc), go back to the main menu (M), or quit the game (X out). <br />
During the game, if the user experiences an issue with the map generation, they can press the backslash key to regenerate the map. <br />
